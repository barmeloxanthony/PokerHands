# PokerHands
This is an ongoing project where I'm using different machine learning techniques to create a model that can predict if a 5 card combination is a poker hand with > 90% accuracy. This is my first time using Jupyter, SciKit, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

This project is incomplete because I still haven't tested clusteirng algorithms or tried relational modeling techniques. I don't know if either of those will improve my accuracy past 90%, and if neither of them work, I have to find other techniques to use.

This currently reflects my progress up to 1/12/18.
